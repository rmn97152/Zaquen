* TODO Answer Two Questions
** Question 1
   How many spanning trees does an n-rung ladder graph have?
   | n | NST(n) |
   |---+--------|
   | 1 |        |
   | 2 |        |
   | 3 |        |
   | 4 |        |

   What is the formula for computing NST(n) in general?

** Question 2
   How many of these spanning trees include the bottom rung?
   | n | NSTIBR(n) |
   |---+-----------|
   | 1 |           |
   | 2 |           |
   | 3 |           |
   | 4 |           |

   What is the formula for computing NSTIBR(n) in general?
