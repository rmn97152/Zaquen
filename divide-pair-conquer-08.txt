* TODO Search for Smallest
  What is the smallest pair of primes that results in a *near-total* derangement
  of encrypted values (the count of the number of times m = m^e % n is at most 3)?

  Why *near-total*? Because 0 to any power is still 0, and 1 to any power is
  still 1, so those two will always stay fixed. Likewise, for (some? all?) n
  and e, (n - 1)^e % n = n - 1.

:HINT:
  Use the smallest valid e for the given p and q.
