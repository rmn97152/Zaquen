* TODO Investigate Word Problems
** Excerpt from Roger Penrose\rsquo{}s /The Emperor\rsquo{}s New Mind/
  Let us consider a different type of problem, called the word problem.

  Suppose that we have some alphabet of symbols, and we consider various strings
  of these symbols, referred to as words. The words need not in themselves have
  any meaning, but we shall be given a certain (finite) list of \lsquo{}equivalences\rsquo
  between them which we are allowed to use in order to derive further such
  \lsquo{}equivalences\rsquo. This is done by making substitutions of words from the initial
  list into other (normally longer) words which contain them as portions. Each
  such portion may be replaced by another portion which is deemed to be
  equivalent to it according to the list. The problem is then to decide, for
  some given pair of words, whether or not they are \lsquo{}equivalent\rsquo according to
  these rules.

  As an example, we might have, for our initial list:

  1. EAT \equiv AT
  2. ATE \equiv A
  3. LATER \equiv LOW
  4. PAN \equiv PILLOW
  5. CARP \equiv ME.

  From these we can derive, for example, LAP \equiv LEAP by use of successive
  substitutions from the second (going right-to-left), the first (going
  right-to-left), and again the second (this time going left-to-right) of the
  relations from the initial list:

  LAP \equiv LATEP \equiv LEATEP \equiv LEAP.

  The problem now is, given some pair of words, can we get from one to the other
  simply using such substitutions? Can we, for example, get from CATERPILLAR to
  MAN, or, say, from CARPET to MEAT? [What do you think?]

  When the answer is \lsquo{}yes\rsquo, the normal way to show this would be simply to
  exhibit a string of equivalences where each word is obtained from the
  preceding one by use of an allowed relation. Thus:

  CATERPILLAR \equiv CARPILLAR \equiv CARPILLATER \equiv CARPILLOW \equiv CARPAN \equiv MEAN \equiv MEATEN \equiv
  MATEN \equiv MAN.

  How can we tell whether or not it is impossible to get from CARPET to MEAT by
  means of the allowed rules? For this, we need to think a little more, but it
  is not hard to see, in a variety of different ways. The simplest appears to be
  the following: in every \lsquo{}equivalence\rsquo in our initial list, the number of As
  plus the number of Ws plus the number of Ms is the same on each side. Thus the
  total number of As, Ws, and Ms cannot change throughout any succession of
  allowed substitutions.

  However, for CARPET this number is 1 whereas for MEAT it is 2.

  Consequently, there is no way of getting from CARPET to MEAT by allowed
  substitutions.

  Notice that when the two words are \lsquo{}equivalent\rsquo we can show this simply by
  exhibiting an allowed formal string of symbols, using the rules that we had been
  given; whereas in the case where they are \lsquo{}inequivalent\rsquo, we had to resort to
  arguments about the rules that we had been given. There is a clear algorithm
  that we can use to establish \lsquo{}equivalence\rsquo between words whenever the words are
  in fact \lsquo{}equivalent\rsquo. All we need do is to make a lexicographical listing of all
  the possible sequences of words, and then strike from this list any such string
  for which there is a pair of consecutive words where the second does not follow
  from the first by an allowed rule. The remaining sequences will provide all the
  sought-for \lsquo{}equivalences\rsquo between words. However, there is no such obvious
  algorithm, in general, for deciding when two words are not \lsquo{}equivalent\rsquo, and we
  may have to resort to \lsquo{}intelligence\rsquo in order to establish that fact. [...]

  Intelligence, incidentally, is useful although not necessary also for
  establishing the existence of an \lsquo{}equivalence\rsquo. In fact, for the particular list
  of five \lsquo{}equivalences\rsquo that constitute the initial list in the above case, it is
  not unduly difficult to provide an algorithm for ascertaining that two words are
  \lsquo{}inequivalent\rsquo when they are indeed \lsquo{}inequivalent\rsquo. However, in order to find
  the algorithm that works in this case we need to exercise a certain amount of
  intelligence! Indeed, it turns out that there is no single algorithm which can
  be used universally for all possible choices of initial list. In this sense
  there is no algorithmic solution to the word problem [in the general case].

  The general word problem belongs to non-recursive mathematics!

  There are even certain particular selections of initial list for which there is
  no algorithm for deciding when two words are \lsquo{}inequivalent\rsquo. One such is given
  by

  1. AH \equiv HA
  2. OH \equiv HO
  3. AT \equiv TA
  4. OF \equiv TO
  5. TAI \equiv IT
  6. HOI \equiv IH
  7. THAT \equiv ITHT

  (This list is adapted from one given in 1955 by G. S. Tseitin and Dana Scott;
  see Gardner 1958, p. 144.) Thus this particular word problem by itself is an
  example of non-recursive mathematics, in the sense that using this particular
  initial list we cannot algorithmically decide whether or not two given words are
  \lsquo{}equivalent\rsquo.

  The general word problem arose from considerations of formalized mathematical
  logic (\lsquo{}formal systems\rsquo etc., as we considered earlier).

  The initial list plays the role of an axiom system and the substitution rule for
  words, the role of the formal rules of procedure. The proof of non-recursiveness
  for the word problem arises from such considerations.

** TODO Try It on This Instance
   (This is the same as above.)

   1. EAT \equiv AT
   2. ATE \equiv A
   3. LATER \equiv LOW
   4. PAN \equiv PILLOW
   5. CARP \equiv ME

*** An Easy One
    Is LAP \equiv LEAP?
**** Answer
     Yes, shown by the following:

   | Equivalence    | By Which Rule? | Applied in Which Direction? |
   |----------------+----------------+-----------------------------|
   | LAP \equiv LATEP    |              2 | right-to-left               |
   | LATEP \equiv LEATEP |              1 | right-to-left               |
   | LEATEP \equiv LEAP  |              2 | left-to-right               |

*** What About?
    Is CATERPILLAR \equiv MAN?
    YES
    You do this one, using a table as shown above.
*** And What About?
    Is CARPET \equiv MEAT?
    NO
    You do this one too.
** TODO Be Creative
   Come up with your own instance of a word problem, with at least five (5)
   equivalences. Find at least one pair of words that you can show are
   equivalent, as in the examples shown. Find at least one pair of words that
   you can reason are *NOT* equivalent.

   E = I
   I = T
   R = S
   S = F
   P = Q
   N = R

   SINE = FIRE
   PITS != TOON

* TODO My Report on What I Learned
  A large part of learning is to reflect and report on what you learned.

  Evidence should also be there that you took steps (which ones?) to eliminate
  MIs (see =assertions-about-MIs= below).

** How I had fun
   I always enjoy a fun puzzle!
** What new I learned
