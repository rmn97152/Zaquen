* TODO Explore and Learn
  As its name implies, Divide Pair Conquer (DPC) requires working in pairs.

  For better or worse, pairing is a part of learning to work well with others.
  Some people find working in small groups easier when n > 2 than when n = 2, so
  the challenge is to make it work with just two.

  The real pairing in life is, of course, marriage, which in our culture is
  usually preceded by dating. Defying logic and reason sometimes, dating in
  reality is scary for many because of its messiness as a process with
  ill-defined outcomes. Interestingly, dating in the abstract has a history of
  analysis in computer science.
** For Example
   Suppose N boys and N girls join a dating service.

   We write down an N-by-N matrix, where the (i, j) entry equals 1 if boy i
   and girl j are willing to date each other, and 0 if they aren’t.

   Is it possible to pair off every boy and girl with a willing partner?

   Here’s a simple way to find out:

   First rescale every row of the matrix to sum to 1.

   Then rescale every column to sum to 1.

   Then rescale every row, then rescale every column, and so on N^5 times.

   If at the end of this scaling process, every row sum and every column sum is
   between (inclusive) 1 - 1/N and 1 + 1/N, then it’s possible to pair off the
   boys and girls; otherwise it isn’t.

   How does this work? Can you explain it?!

   The following code may help:
#+begin_src elisp :results silent
  (defun scale-list (lst)
    (let ((sum (float (apply '+ lst))))
      (if (zerop sum)
          (error "no can do")
        (mapcar (lambda (x) (/ x sum)) lst))))

  (defun scale-rows (matrix)
    (mapcar 'scale-list matrix))

  (defun scale-columns (matrix)
    (let ((transpose (apply 'mapcar* 'list matrix)))
      (apply 'mapcar* 'list (scale-rows transpose))))

  (defun scale-matrix (n matrix)
    (or (and (= n (length matrix))
             (every (lambda (row) (= n (length row))) matrix))
        (error "bad parameters"))
    (loop repeat (expt n 5)
            do (setq matrix (scale-rows matrix)
                     matrix (scale-columns matrix)))
    matrix)

  (defun verify-matrix (n matrix)
    (let* ((one-over-n (/ 1 (float n)))
           (lo (- 1 one-over-n))
           (hi (+ 1 one-over-n))
           (transpose (apply 'mapcar* 'list matrix)))
      (and (every (lambda (row)
                    (let ((sum (apply '+ row)))
                      (and (<= lo sum)
                           (<= sum hi))))
                  matrix)
           (every (lambda (col)
                    (let ((sum (apply '+ col)))
                      (and (<= lo sum)
                           (<= sum hi))))
                  transpose))))
#+end_src

   Sample use of the above code:

   #+name: five-by-five
   | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
   | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
   | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

#+name: five-by-five-scaled
#+begin_src elisp :var matrix=five-by-five
  (scale-matrix 5 matrix)
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp :var matrix=five-by-five-scaled
  (loop for row in matrix
        collect (loop for col in row
                      collect (format "%0.2f" col)))
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp :var matrix=five-by-five-scaled
  (verify-matrix 5 matrix)
#+end_src

** For Your Main Task
  Think about and discuss this problem in the abstract and in reality. Focus
  particularly on the intersection of the dating service problem with
  probability theory and graph theory.
