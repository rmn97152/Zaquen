  Here are three papers to read and ponder about this week:

  1. [[http://matt.might.net/papers/liang2014godel.pdf][Fast Flow Analysis with G\ouml{}del Hashes]] (finish reading if you haven\rsquo{}t already)
  2. [[https://rickneff.github.io/the-perfect-language.pdf][The Perfect Language]] (transcript of a talk by Gregory Chaitin)
  3. [[https://rickneff.github.io/the-limits-of-reason.pdf][The Limits of Reason]] (this talk surveys the key developments before and
     after Kurt G\ouml{}del\rsquo{}s Incompleteness Theorem)

* TODO What Is True?
   This is a tool that allows you to assess yourself on how you did
   with this assignment. Check a box (using , ,) if warranted.
