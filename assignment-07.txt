* TODO Explore Fermat\rsquo{}s Little Theorem Further
  Fermat\rsquo{}s Little Theorem (FLT) says that if N is prime, then N divides X^N - X.

  Remember, the contrapositive of the conditional statement in this theorem is
  that if N *doesn\rsquo{}t* divide X^N - X for some X, then N *can\rsquo{}t* be prime.

  Unfortunately, this simple primality test doesn\rsquo{}t always work, because
  *pseudoprimes* fool it.

  341 = 11 \cdot 31 is not prime. But 341 *does* divide 2^{341} - 2.
#+begin_src elisp
  (calc-eval "((2^341)-2)%341")
#+end_src

#+results:
: 0

  So 341 is a *base-2 pseudoprime*. What about *base-3*?

#+begin_src elisp
  (calc-eval "((3^341)-3)%341")
#+end_src

#+results:
: 165

  So 341 is *not* a *base-3* pseudoprime.

  Are there any other bases that will not fool the FLT test for 341?

  Are there any pseudoprimes that will fool the FLT for *any choice* of base
  (as long as that base is coprime to the pseudoprime)?

:ANSWER:
  Yes! Your task is the find the first 4-digit *bullet-proof pseudoprime* and prove
  that it will fool the FLT test for every base coprime to it.
:END:
:IMPORTANT:
  Your proof must use all of the following:
  1) the definition of coprime, a consequence of coprimality,
  2) the factorization of the *bppp*,
  3) FLT, and
  4) the CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem).

* TODO Characterize a Letter-to-Number Mapping
  Learn to think like Brother Neff! (If this sounds hard --- it is! It is meant
  to be a challenge. :-)

  Fill out the following table like he would. Put Xs in the appropriate column
  (maybe more than one per row). The first four rows have been done for you:

  | Letter | Number | Visual       | Aural         | Other                     |
  |        |        | (looks like) | (sounds like) | (some logical reason)     |
  |--------+--------+--------------+---------------+---------------------------|
  | A      |      8 |              | X             |                           |
  | B      |      9 |              |               | X (B9 (benign) is a word) |
  | C      |      0 | X            |               |                           |
  | D      |      0 | X            |               |                           |
  | E      |      3 |              |               |                           |

  | O      |      1 |              |               |                           |

  | R      |      4 |              |               |                           |
  | S      |      7 |              |               |                           |
  | T      |      2 |              |               |                           |
  | U      |      1 |              |               |                           |
  | V      |      5 |              |               |                           |
  | W      |      2 |              |               |                           |
  | X      |      6 |              |               |                           |
  | Y      |      7 |              |               |                           |
  | Z      |      0 |              |               |                           |

* TODO Code The Inverse Mapping
  Since the letters-to-number mapping was many-to-one, the inverse
  number-to-letters mapping will be one-to-many:

  | Number | Letters |
  |--------+---------|
  |      0 | ZCD     |
  |      1 | OU      |
  |      2 | TW      |
  |      3 | EM      |
  |      4 | QR      |
  |      5 | FIV     |
  |      6 | GJX     |
  |      7 | SLY     |
  |      8 | AHK     |
  |      9 | BNP     |

  Write elisp code to take a string of 3 digits and generate a random TLA with
  this mapping.

  For full credit, *make sure* that your elisp code is *efficient*, and that it
  generates a [[file:expound-on-topics-07.txt][true random NOT a pseudorandom]] TLA.

* TODO Discern a Pattern
  In his book Brother Neff uses a TLA-based naming scheme to identify major
  headings, minor headings, minor subheadings, and EPPs.

  The pattern for major/minor headings is trivial to discern:
  - ONE
    - ABC
    - DEF
    - GHI
  - TWO
    - JKL
    - MNO
    - PQR
  - THR
    - STU
    - VWX
    - YZ@

  Minor subheadings have an easily-discernible pattern as well, e.g.:

  (ABC ABD ABE ABF ABG ABH ABI ABJ ABK ABL ABM ABN ABO)

  What about the EPPs (Exercises, Problems, Puzzles)? What is their pattern?

* TODO My Report on What I Learned
** How I had fun
** How I collaborated
** What new I learned
** What meaningful I achieved
** Etc.
* TODO What Is True?
   This is a tool that allows you to assess yourself on how you did
   with this assignment. Check a box (using , ,) if warranted.

   What is true of my experience in general?
#+name: assertions-in-general
  - [ ] I had fun.
  - [ ] I collaborated with one or more classmates.

  - [ ] I got the right answer for the \ldquo{}Characterize a Letter-to-Number Mapping\rdquo problem.
  - [ ] I wrote provably correct code for the \ldquo{}Inverse Mapping\rdquo.
  - [ ] My code used true randomness not pseudorandomness.
