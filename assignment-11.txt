* TODO Investigate Something Fascinating
  You are invited to explore some of the ramifications of the /Pigeonhole
  Principle/, a fascinating counting principle belonging to combinatorics.

** Requirements
   Read Brother Kent Bessey's essay entitled /Pigeons and Pigeonholes/, think
   about and explore the topics therein, and write your response thereto.

   Include in your response a description of a discussion about this essay that
   you will have had with someone /not in the class/ (nor in any of the STEM
   majors). This person can be a spouse, friend, roommate, or relative. The
   point is to find someone who is not mathematically strong, and has probably
   never heard of the Pigeonhole Principle, or combinatorics (or discrete
   mathematics) in general.

** Copyright Note
   Brother Kent A. Bessey, Professor of Mathematics at BYU-Idaho,
   holds the copyright to this essay, which means:

* TODO Concretize the Abstract by Writing Some Code
  Specifically, write some elisp code to help you figure out the problem on
  page 40, which Brother Bessey prefaces by saying:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
   I leave it to the reader to verify the calculations
   for a final (albeit challenging) exercise ...!
#+END_QUOTE

  Include the results of your grappling with this problem, and note the two
  stubbed functions below that you must flesh out in order to verify the
  calculations and explain the hows and whys.

** Stub Code
#+begin_src elisp
  (defun calculate-number-of-possible-initials-including-middle-initial-if-any
      (number-of-letters-in-the-English-alphabet)
    ;;... your code goes here
  )

  (defun pigeonhole-from-pigeon (pigeon-represented-as-a-person-with-traits)
    ;;... your code goes here
  )

* TODO My Report on What I Learned
  A large part of learning is to reflect and report on what you learned.

  Something should be in your report addressing each of the
  =assertions-about-report= below.

  Evidence should also be there that you took steps (which ones?) to eliminate
  MIs (see =assertions-about-MIs= below).

** How I had fun
   I really enjoyed the essay!
** What new I learned
   The concept of pigeonholes.
** What meaningful I achieved
   I achieved a better understanding of pigeonholes.
** Etc.
* TODO What Is True?
  This is a tool that allows you to assess yourself on how you did
  with this assignment. Check a box (using , ,) if warranted.

#+name: assertions-in-general
  - [X] I had fun.
  - [X] I learned something new.
  - [X] I achieved something meaningful, or something I can build upon at a later time.

   What is true of my report on what I learned?
#+name: assertions-about-report
  - [X] I responded with a sufficient number of well-written sentences to
        Brother Bessey\rsquo{}s essay.
  - [X] I reported what I thought about the essay in general.
  - [X] I reported what I thought about the certainty-not-chance feature of the
        pigeonhole principle.
  - [X] I reported what I thought about the philosophical aspect of the
        pigeonhole principle per page 41.
  - [X] I reported on how my discussion with a non-STEM non-classmate went.
  - [X] I reported on how I grappled with the problem at the bottom of page 40.
  - [X] I reported on the connection I found between the pigeonhole principle
        and graphs.
  - [X] I reported on the connection I found between the pigeonhole principle
        and lossless data compression.

   What is true of the \ldquo{}mechanical infelicities\rdquo (misspelled words, grammatical
   errors, punctuation errors) in my report of what I learned?
#+name: assertions-about-MIs
  - [X] There are fewer than four.
  - [X] There are fewer than three.
  - [X] There are fewer than two.
  - [X] There are none.

   How well did I implement the function
   =calculate-number-of-possible-initials-including-middle-initial-if-any=?
#+name: assertions-about-easy-function
  - [X] I implemented the function in 3 or fewer lines of code.
  - [X] I used either the sum rule and product rule together or else just the
        product rule.
  - [X] The function calculates and returns the correct value (see Problem QFK).

   How well did I implement the =pigeonhole-from-pigeon= function?
#+name: assertions-about-harder-function
  - [X] The function reads from this buffer the list named "John Doe" and
        returns the string "J D:111001".
  - [X] The function has an assert that the length of the string being returned
        is 10.
  - [ ] The function calls
        (calculate-number-of-possible-initials-including-middle-initial-if-any 26)
        and uses the result.
  - [ ] The function has an assert that the cardinality of its codomain (set of
        possible return values) is over a million.

#+name: John Doe
  - [X] LDS
  - [X] Likes Cats
  - [X] Born Before
  - [ ] Wears Contacts
  - [ ] Bites Fingernails
