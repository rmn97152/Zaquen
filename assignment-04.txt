* TODO Read and Relate
  Read the next 3 pages of [[http://matt.might.net/papers/liang2014godel.pdf][the Matt Might paper you have been reading]], that is,
  pages 5, 6, and 7 (up to but not including section VI).

  Relate what you read in this paper about partial orders and posets to what you
  learn this week about these special type of relations and their applications.

* TODO Understand and Write
  Understand the techniques of construction of the standard set-theoretic
  operations and relations out of arithmetic. Quoting from page 3:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  On the G\ouml{}del hash of a set, familiar number-theoretic operations become
  set-theoretic operations: modulo tests both membership and subset-inclusion;
  union becomes least common multiple; and intersection becomes greatest-common
  divisor.
#+END_QUOTE

  Understand also how relations can be encoded as sets of pairs.

  Write elisp code to enhance your understanding of these encodings and
  constructions.

* TODO What Is True?
   This is a tool that allows you to assess yourself on how you did
   with this assignment. Check a box (using , ,) if warranted.

   What is true of my experience in general?
#+name: assertions-in-general
  - [ ] I had fun.
  - [ ] I collaborated with one or more classmates.
  - [ ] I learned something new.
  - [ ] I achieved something meaningful, or something I can build upon at a later time.

   What is true of my report on what I learned?
#+name: assertions-about-report
  - [ ] I wrote a sufficient number of well-written sentences.
  - [ ] I reported on any connections I found between these problems and
        something I already know.
  - [ ] I reported who were and what contribution each of my collaborators made.

   What is true of the \ldquo{}mechanical infelicities\rdquo (misspelled words, grammatical
   errors, punctuation errors) in my report of what I learned?
#+name: assertions-about-MIs
  - [ ] There are fewer than four.
  - [ ] There are fewer than three.
  - [ ] There are fewer than two.
  - [ ] There are none.

   What is true about the correctness and completeness of my code?
#+name: assertions-about-correctness-and-completeness-of-code
  - [ ] It correctly calculates set membership.
  - [ ] It correctly calculates subset-inclusion.
  - [ ] It correctly calculates set union.
  - [ ] It correctly calculates set intersection.
  - [ ] It correctly encodes relations as sets of pairs.
  - [ ] It correctly uses bigpos arithmetic via the 'calc' and 'calc-math'
        packages.

   What is true about the elegance of my code?
#+name: assertions-about-elegance-of-code
  - [ ] It has some by virtue of its correctness, as first and foremost, an
        elegant solution is a correct solution.
  - [ ] It increases by means of helper functions that increase cohesion, and
        decrease complexity.
  - [ ] It increases by having no unnecessary, redundant functionality.
  - [ ] It increases by using data types/structures as efficiently as possible.
  - [ ] My main code block has only function definitions (defuns) in it, NO
        function calls or other expressions.
  - [ ] I used a/several separate code block(s) for my test driver function(s).

   What is true of the depth of my engagement with this assignment?
#+name: assertions-about-depth-of-engagement
  - [ ] I used sets of sufficient size that doing bigpos arithmetic was necessary.
  - [ ] Even if I have not yet taken Algorithms and Complexity (CS 306) I tried
        to understand what the paper says about the space efficiency and the time
        efficiency of the operations on G\ouml{}del hashes for sets.

   What is true of the above-and-beyond depth of my engagement with this assignment?
#+name: assertions-about-above-and-beyond-depth-of-engagement
  - [ ] I researched and learned what it means for a poset to have a /prime basis/.
  - [ ] I researched lattices so as to better understand Section V, especially
        where it talks about promoting a partial order to a lattice.
