* TODO Investigate A Possible Relationship
  Does any row in Pascal\rsquo{}s Triangle have the Fibonacci numbers\rsquo relationship
  between three consecutive entries (in other words, where x, y and z are three
  consecutive entries in a single row, x + y = z)?

  The number of rows where this relationship could possibly hold is:
  - [ ] Zero.
  - [ ] At least one.
  - [ ] At most one.
  - [ ] Exactly one.
  - [ ] It cannot be determined.

* TODO Investigate Another Possible Relationship
   Does any row in Pascal\rsquo{}s Triangle have three consecutive entries in the ratio
   1:2:3? (12:24:36 is an example of three numbers in a 1:2:3 ratio.)

   The number of rows where this relationship could possibly hold is:
- [ ] Zero.
- [ ] At least one.
- [ ] At most one.
- [ ] Exactly one.
- [ ] It cannot be determined.
