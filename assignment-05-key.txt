* Combinatorial Proofs
** Validate A Committee with Chair and Co-Chair Identity Exemplary Answer
  A *combinatorial argument* that if n is a positive integer then

  \(\sum^n_{k = 0} k^2{n \choose k} = n(n + 1)2^{n - 2}.\)

  goes as follows:

  Following the hint, first note that we can start the summation with /k = 1/,
  since the term with /k = 0/ is 0. The left-hand side counts the number of ways
  to choose a subset as described in the hint by breaking it down by the number
  of elements in the subset; note that there are /k/ ways to choose each of the
  distinguished elements if the subset has size /k/. For the right-hand side,
  after changing by per the hint from n(n + 1)2^{n - 2} to n(n - 1 + 2)2^{n - 2} =
  n(n - 1)2^{n - 2} + n2^{n - 1}. The first term counts the number of ways to make
  this choice if the two distinguished elements are different (choose them, then
  choose any subset of the remaining elements to be the rest of the subset). The
  second term counts the number of ways to make this choice if the two
  distinguished elements are the same (choose it, then choose any subset of the
  remaining elements to be the rest of the subset). Note that this works even if
  /n = 1/.

** Validate Another Identity Exemplary Answer
  A *combinatorial argument* for the validity of the identity

  \({n \choose r}{r \choose k} = {n \choose k}{n - k \choose r - k}\)

  goes as follows:

  Suppose that we have a set with /n/ elements, and we wish to choose a subset
  /A/ with /k/ elements and another, disjoint, subset, with /r - k/ elements.
  The left-hand side gives us the number of ways to do this, namely the product
  of the number of ways to choose the /r/ elements that are to go into one or
  the other of the subsets and the number of ways to choose which of /these/
  elements are to go into the first of the subsets. The right-hand side gives us
  the number of ways to do this as well, namely the product of the number of
  ways to choose the first subset and the number of ways to choose the second
  subset from the elements that remain.

* Basic Probability Theory
** Answer a Probability Question
   Using the hint, since they\rsquo{}re all independent events, the probability of
   choosing n green marbles in a row from the half-and-half barrel is (1/2)^n.
   Compute the complementary probability --- that of choosing at least one blue
   marble --- to be 1 - (1/2)^n. That probability first exceeds 99% when n
   equals 7. That is when 2^n > 100, which is saying 1 - (1/2)^n > .99 in an
   equivalent way.

** Answer Another Probability Question
   Take a deep breath. Suppose Shakespeare\rsquo{}s account is accurate and Julius
   Caesar gasped \ldquo{}You too, Brutus\rdquo before breathing his last. What is the
   probability that you just inhaled a molecule that Julius Caesar exhaled in
   his dying breath?

   Assume that after more than two thousand years the exhaled molecules are
   uniformly spread about the world and the vast majority are still free in the
   atmosphere. Assume further that there are 10^{44} molecules of air in the world,
   and that your inhaled quantity and Caesar\rsquo{}s exhaled quantity were each about
   2.2 x 10^{22} molecules.

:HINT:
   If a number x is small, then (1 - x) is approximately equal to e^{-x}, where e =
   2.718281828 (approximately).

#+begin_src elisp :results raw
  (exp 1)
#+end_src
:END:

  2.2 x 10^{22} molecules in each breath, yours or Caesar\rsquo{}s.

  We want one minus the probability that your next breath does NOT contain one
  of Caesar\rsquo{}s dying breath air molecules.

  2.2 \times 10^22 / 10^44 (call it tiny) is the probability that the next molecule you
  breath is one of Caesar\rsquo{}s. So (1 - tiny) is the probability that the next
  molecule is NOT one of his. That probability (call it next) needs to be
  multiplied by itself 2.2 \times 10^22 times --- next \times next \times ... \times next (2.2 \times 10^22
  times) to give the probability that NONE of the molecules in your next breath
  came from Caesar: (1 - tiny)^{2.2 \times 10^22}

  Using (1 - x) is approximately equal to e^{-x}, where x = 4.84 (2.2 \times 2.2 --- the
  10^22 \times 10^22 / 10^44 reduces to 1), 1 minus that is:
