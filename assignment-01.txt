* TODO What about these numbers?
   Can you discern the pattern in these numbers?
   1 2 11 3 1 x 4 11 1 2 2
   If so, to follow the pattern by what non-zero number would you replace 0?

* TODO Answer a What Question and a Why Question
 What is the cardinality of the /Power Set/ of a set of size n? Why?

   2^n. It is the total amount of subsets of the original set.

* TODO Answer a Fuzzy Question
  Investigate and report on some application of *fuzzy sets* and *fuzzy logic*.

  Facial Recogonition uses that with a percentage of how likely the match is.

* TODO Answer a Hash Question
  From your increased understanding following your reading of the first four
  pages of the [[http://matt.might.net/papers/liang2014godel.pdf][Fast Flow Analysis with G\ouml{}del Hashes]] paper, compute the hash as
  shown in class for a few sets and subsets of your devising.

  What observations can you make?

  (We will be reading and revisiting this paper throughout the semester as we
  learn more discrete mathematics.)

* TODO My Report On What I Learned
** I Had Fun
** I Learned Something New
** I Achieved Something Meaningful
** Etc.

* TODO What Is True?
   This is a tool that allows you to assess yourself on how you did
   with this assignment. Check a box (using , ,) if warranted.

   What is true of my experience in general?
#+name: assertions-in-general
  - [ ] I had fun.
  - [ ] I learned something new.
  - [ ] I achieved something meaningful, or something I can build upon at a later time.

   What is true of my report on what I learned?
#+name: assertions-about-report
  - [ ] I wrote a sufficient number of well-written sentences.
  - [ ] I reported what I thought about while doing the problems.
  - [ ] I reported on any connections I found between these problems and something I already know.
  - [ ] I reported who were and what contribution each of my collaborators made.

   What is true of the \ldquo{}mechanical infelicities\rdquo (misspelled words, grammatical
   errors, punctuation errors) in my report of what I learned?
#+name: assertions-about-MIs
  - [ ] There are fewer than four.
  - [ ] There are fewer than three.
  - [ ] There are fewer than two.
  - [ ] There are none.

#+name: assertions-about-answers
  - [ ] I got the right answer for the first question about numbers.
  - [ ] I got the right answer for the second question about numbers.
  - [ ] I got the right answer for the first question about sets.
  - [ ] I did more than parrot some answer I found online about fuzzy sets/logic.
  - [ ] I computed the G\ouml{}del Hashes of some interesting (non-trivial) sets/subsets.
  - [ ] I made some astute observations about G\ouml{}del Hashes.

#+name: assertions-about-aab
  - [ ] I went above and beyond in my answer to the first question about numbers.
