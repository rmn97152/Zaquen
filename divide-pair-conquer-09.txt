* TODO Create Tree and Codes
  This is a warmup for your main assignment this week.

  Create a Huffman Tree and codes for the gaps between the first 100 primes
  (except for the gap of size 1 between 2 and 3).

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'first-ten-million-primes)

  (setq the-data (subseq first-ten-million-primes 2 100)
        list-of-gaps (loop with prev = 3
                           with gap = 0
                           for prime across the-data
                           do (setq gap (- prime prev)
                                    prev prime)
                           collect gap)
        table (mapcar 'list list-of-gaps))
