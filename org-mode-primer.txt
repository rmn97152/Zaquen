* Preliminaries
** Basics
  The third column of [[https://ontologicalblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/spacemacs_cheat_sheet_1-22.pdf][this Spacemacs cheat sheet]] has some Org Mode helps.
  Check it out!

** Pretty Entities
  There is a \ldquo{}startup\rdquo attribute missing from this file that appears in other
  files you already have: entitiespretty

  If you include it, when you visit this file you will start up in the *entities
  pretty* display mode. Otherwise, you will see the \ldquo{}ORG entity\rdquo as a backslash
  (\) followed by the name of a symbol.

  If you type Control-C (C-c) followed by Control-x (C-x) followed by the
  backslash (\) character, you will run the

  =org-toggle-pretty-entities=

  command. Of course,

  =SPC SPC org-toggle-pretty-entities=

  will also invoke it, but at the cost of more typing.

*** Warmup
  Try it: C-c C-x \

  then remove each of the spaces that just follow the four backslashes below to
  see how they change to a symbol.

  \ sum

  \ prod

  \ forall

  \ exists

  (Type the u character four times to undo those four deletions.)

** Subscripts and Superscripts

  To create a subscript, type an underscore (_) character just after a letter or
  word, then the SINGLE character you want as the subscript.

  For example, a _ 1

  typed without the spaces before and after the underscore produces

  a_1

  If you want more than a single character to be the subscript, type an open ({)
  and close (}) curly brace before and after the subscript text.

  For example, type

  node _ { prev }

  without the spaces to see

  node_{prev}

* More symbols and math writing
  If you remember learning this in a calculus class, great! If not, you
  are not expected to understand it --- just play with the symbols!

  The definition of the limit of a real-valued function *f(x)* of a real
  variable *x* at a point *a* in its domain goes like this:

  lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L

  means

  \forall \epsilon > 0 \exists \delta > 0 \forall x (0 < |x - a| < \delta \rightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon).

* TODO Create your own table
  Type C-h i (for help info) and scroll down to and hit enter (or click) on the
  Org Mode menu item, and likewise for the Tables menu item under that. Learn
  this powerful magic and you will be amazed at what you can do!

  | Type a backslash (\) |        |
  | followed by          | to see |
  |----------------------+--------|
  | sum                  | \sum      |
  | prod                 | \prod      |
  | forall               | \forall      |
  | exist                | \exist      |
  | ...                  |        |
  | (you fill in         |        |
  | a dozen or so        |        |
  | more rows)           |        |

  To help you accomplish this task:

  =SPC SPC org-entities-help=

  is your friend.

  Subject: Spacemacs/VIM - My testimony for your students

  I remember sitting in your class and thinking “spacemacs, you are the most
  stupid thing ever created and I hate you.” I didn’t like editing with VIM
  key bindings. I forced myself to learn and to get used to it for discrete
  math but I still hated it a little.

  Now I have an internship and on a really good suggestion I decided to keep a
  journal. Not one of those journals in which you write about how you feel but
  a programmer’s journal. I keep a record of everything I do. I thought for a
  bit what was the best way to do it and honestly I couldn’t think of a better
  way to do it than in ORG MODE!!! I was laughing because at the beginning when
  I started using VI I hated it and now the more I use it the more helpful it
  is and the more comfortable I feel with it so tell your students to not be
  as stupid as this Guatemalan friend of yours but to learn to love the power
  of VI and to learn how to use it, because if they hate it it is probably
  because they don’t know how to use it.

  I have here a tip that will make them feel they are using one of those fancy
  IDEs they use now: Enable auto completion. This will help with some basic
  errors and even improve your spelling. This is commented out in your
  configuration but it is really nice once you enable it. (SPC f e d)

  You can see there the work of basically 2 days. There is a lot there because
  real life is not like college but honestly org mode is amazing. Saves you a
  lot of time if you have the right configuration. Tell them to save a copy of
  the .spacemacs.d files we use in DM. It is easier than trying to download
  and install packages and layers. One very useful package is the one that
  lets you import pictures just dragging them into spacemacs.

  Thanks for not changing DM and letting us use our dumbifiers (IDEs).
  Honestly a lot of people hate the class because of that, but that is nothing
  but a proof of how ignorant we can be in college. Don’t worry we realize
  eventually how wrong we were!
