* TODO Four Mini-Tasks
** TODO 1
   Which step in the inductive proof of FLT best connects with a basic pattern
   found in *some* but *NOT all* rows of Pascal\rsquo{}s Triangle?
** TODO 2
   Show that the positive integers less than 11, except 1 and 10, can be split
   into pairs of integers such that each pair consists of integers that are
   (Modular Multiplicative) inverses of each other modulo 11.
** TODO 3
   Use what you just showed to show that 10! \equiv_{11} -1.

   (Note that for any N and m, N \equiv_m -1 is saying the same thing as N \equiv_m m - 1.)
** TODO 4
   In file:presentation-07.txt::*Equivalently, why does the last suggested way
   *not work* for calculating the MMI of the encryption exponent to get the
   decryption exponent for RSA?
