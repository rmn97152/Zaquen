* What\rsquo{}s It All About?
  This course is about *mathematics for computer science.*

  It delves deeper into the mathematical topics needed to provide a solid
  theoretical foundation for your career and continued learning in computer
  science.

  The following topics will be covered:

  + Sets and Logic
  + Functions and Relations
  + Combinatorics and Probability
  + Number Theory and Practice
  + Trees and Graphs
  + Languages and Grammars

* Outcomes
  + Master more advanced terminology and operations of sets and logic, functions
    and relations, combinatorics and probability, number theory and practice,
    trees and graphs, and languages and grammars.
  + Demonstrate logical reasoning as you solve interesting problems.
  + Learn more advanced programming by way of elisp, reading and writing elisp
    code. (See [[file:elisp-mini-primer.txt][elisp-mini-primer.txt]] for a refresher.)
  + Discern between effective and ineffective approaches to problem solving.
  + Solve problems using limited or constrained resources.

* Prerequisites
  + You must have successfully completed CS 237 Discrete Mathematics I.
  + You must also have a basic grasp of elisp (*not* erlang).

* Requirements
** Required Text
  + [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html][Metaphors Be With You]]

  This is an online textbook. No print version is available unless you make it.
  Other supplementary course materials will be made available to you when the
  time comes.
** Required Software
  To install these tools, see the instructions [[https://rickneff.github.io][here]] (and go to the /Tools/
  section).
  + git
  + Emacs/Spacemacs

** Required Accounts
   You are required to have an account using your real name and school email
   address with (at least) these three platforms:
   + https://github.com (free)
   + https://kritik.io (requires paying a $15 fee)
   + https://quizlet.com (free)

** Required Behaviors
  You are required to:
  + attend class each class period (but then again, why wouldn\rsquo{}t you?);
  + read assigned portions of the course materials /before/ class each Tuesday;
  + take “prepare” before-class or in-class quizzes;
  + do “teach one another” in-and-out-of-class exercises;
  + do weekly “ponder and prove” assignments to deepen your understanding of
    selected topics; and
  + bring a laptop or other Internet-connectable (and tools-ready) device to
    each class meeting.
  + maintain a portfolio of your completed work (see below).

* Course Periodicity
  This course has a weekly period, i.e., you can count on knowing ahead of time
  (most of the time) what you will be doing each day of each week. Each class
  meeting consists of the types of activity identified by TLA and described
  below. The day each activity happens may vary, as for example when there is a
  short week.

** Monday
  - PPT (Prayer Plus Tip) :: --- A daily start-us-off
       exercise most of you will have a turn doing.
  - PNI (Present New Information) :: --- A time where I will add depth
       information to the preparation material you finished reading *before
       class*.
  - DPC (Divide Pair Conquer) :: --- A time where you will pair up with a
       partner and conquer a small task during class.

** Tuesday
   - PPT :: --- See above.
   - RAT (Readiness Assurance Test) :: --- A short in-class quiz on the
        reading and topics for the week.
   - CDL (Class Directed Learning) :: --- You will participate in a class-wide
        activity that reinforces what you\rsquo{}ve read and what I\rsquo{}ve shown you. Based
        on Monday\rsquo{}s Presentation and questions on the quiz.

** Wednesday
   - PPT :: --- See above.
   - EOT (Expound on Topics) :: --- A time where I will add more information to
        the topics of the week, or invite one of you to do so!
   - TPS (Team Problem Solving) :: --- A time where you will work in teams on
        the problem(s) for the week.

** Thursday
   - PPT :: --- See above.
   - ASQ (Answer Selected Questions) :: --- I will answer questions that have
       surfaced through various means.
   - HMF (Have Mathy Fun) :: --- If there is time, we will have some
        mathematically oriented fun --- indulge in some kind of recreational
        math exploration, if you will.

* Questions
  + Some of the questions answered on Thursdays are verbatim or generalized from
    those you create via the [[https://rickneff.github.io/kritik-introduction.html][Kritik platform]].
  + Creating and evaluating questions help you develop higher order thinking
    skills.
  + You will have plenty of questions. Engage with them! Choose knowledge over
    ignorance.
* Work
** Exercises
   Exercises are smaller experiences that are designed to float uncertainties and
   questions you have to the surface of your mind. They are designed to be smaller
   so you can find out what you don\rsquo{}t know and then take the steps necessary to
   know.

** Problems
   Problems are weightier experiences that invite you to explore topics in discrete
   mathematics, as well as increase your logical thinking and problem solving
   prowess. Many of these involve writing mathematically (see [[file:org-mode-primer.txt][org-mode-primer.txt]]).

   [[https://rickneff.github.io/exercises-versus-problems.html][Here is a description of the difference]] between Exercises and Problems.

* Assessment
  About every four weeks you will meet with me in my office. The purpose of this
  meeting is for you to present your portfolio of work to me, make a
  grade-to-date claim, and provide evidence justifying that claim.

  Your portfolio *MUST* be a modified version of this file, and those included by
  it. All entries must follow the example format you will find at the end of
  this file. Also, your evidences must be complete and internally consistent.
  You are required to produce your portfolio using Spacemacs, and you *MUST* be
  able to successfully export it as an HTML file (see the link at the top of
  this file).

* Grades
  In each of our three personal meetings, you will present your portfolio and a
  letter-based grade-to-date claim. Afterwards I will give you my thoughts on
  the strength of your claim. The last claim that you make (*not an average* of
  the three), taking into account any feedback from me, will be your final grade
  for the course. All of your claims must must be evidence-based. That means you
  *MUST* bring the evidence with you, in your portfolio, that supports your
  claim.

** Letter-Based
   When making your claim, you are required to use the [[http://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system][BYU-Idaho standard]]
   letter-based definition of grades, reproduced below. *Note with one exception
   that there are no plusses or minuses!*

   + \ldquo{}A\rdquo represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of
     subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use
     of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems.
     Demonstrates diligent application of Learning Model principles, including
     initiative in serving other students.
   + \ldquo{}B\rdquo represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and
     incorporation of the material that would prepare a student to be successful
     in next level courses, graduate school, or employment. The student
     participates in the Learning Model as applied in the course.
   + \ldquo{}C\rdquo represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student
     demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses
     could be attempted, but mastering new materials might prove challenging.
     The student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.
   + \ldquo{}D\rdquo represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and
     apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary
     to prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.
   + \ldquo{}D-\rdquo represents failure in the course. [[https://rickneff.github.io/why-not-f.html][Why not F?]]

   Note that the above description of an \ldquo{}A\rdquo implies that you have gone *above
   and beyond*. To claim this grade you *must* have done and recorded evidence
   in your portfolio of doing *some* of the behaviors listed below, *each week*
   throughout each 4-week period.
   1. teaching and/or helping others in the class but not in your group
   2. teaching a Non-CS, Non-CE, Non-EE, Non-SE major about the material in
      this class to help them with a class they are taking
   3. applying what you\rsquo{}ve learned in this class in another class you are
      currently taking
   4. solving problems marked as optional
   5. solving puzzles
   6. doing other work not assigned, exploring other topics in mathematics,
      writing code implementing what you are learning that has not been
      assigned, etc.

   How many is *some*? It is doing at least two of the first three (1, 2, 3),
   *and* at least two of the last three (4, 5, 6).

   Regarding the first two about teaching others, quoting Truman Madsen (quoting
   the Prophet Joseph Smith): Now one of the strongest and wisest statements I
   have ever heard on egoism. The question was put to him, \ldquo{}Joseph, is the
   principle of self-aggrandizement wrong? Should we seek our own good?\rdquo Listen
   to his answer. \ldquo{}It is a correct principle and may be indulged upon only one
   rule or plan --- and that is to elevate, benefit, and bless others first. If
   you will elevate others, the very work itself will exalt you. Upon no other
   plan can a man justly and permanently aggrandize himself.\rdquo
* Moral/Legal
** Honor Code
   + [[http://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/policy/HJPtItSal?bc=true&bcCurrent=Academic%2520Honesty&bcGroup=University%2520Standards&bcItemType=policies][Academic Honesty]]
   + [[http://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/policy/SkaRPKHTl?bc=true&bcCurrent=Dress%2520and%2520Grooming%2520Standards&bcGroup=University%2520Standards&bcItemType=policies][Dress and Grooming]]

     Quoting from the latter:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Men are expected to be clean-shaven; beards are not acceptable.
#+END_QUOTE
  Regarding the celebrated [[https://byuiscroll.org/beard-card-used-abused/][beard card]]:
  1. Students who are requesting a first-time shaving exemption will be
     required to attend a seminar led by Student Honor Office administrators.
  2. All students who are seeking a shaving exemption, whether it’s a first
     time or a renewal exemption for the new semester, will have a one on one
     meeting with a Student Honor administrator to discuss the policy,
     expectations, and to sign a new commitment to abide by the standard as
     close as medically possible (i.e. no lumberjack beards).
  3. Students who are granted a shaving exemption will receive a printed card.
  4. Faculty members will be notified by the Student Honor Office through
     email when a student registered in their class receives a shaving
     exemption.
  5. All shaving exemptions are granted for no more than one semester and
     expire at the end of each semester.
  6. There will be a short grace period during the first week or two of the
     semester in order to give time for the Student Honor Office to process
     new requests.
  7. After that grace period, if you are not meeting the standard, and we have
     a conversation about it, and if it continues to be a problem, I will
     refer you to the Student Honor Office, which you must visit with before
     returning to class --- either clean-shaven or with a card.
