* Bayes\rsquo Theorem Practice
  You are given these facts about a certain disease with a test for detecting
  its presence in humans:

  .6 percent of the population has the disease,

  the *sensitivity* of the test is 95 percent, and

  the *specificity* of the test is 99.6 percent.

  Note these two statistical terms: *sensitivity* is the probability that the test
  is correct when the disease is present, and *specificity* is the probability
  that the test is correct when the disease is absent.

  Given the above, for this disease and test, what is

  - [ ] the *false positive rate*?

  - [ ] the *true positive rate*?

  - [ ] the *false negative rate*?

  - [ ] the *true negative rate*?

  (You may have to look up those terms.)
