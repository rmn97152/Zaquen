   one million, one hundred one thousand, one hundred twenty-one
:   1     2      3     4     5     6       7    8       9    10

:   1     2       3     4     5     6   7     8    9
** Paradox?!
   The second name appears to name *in nine words* the smallest number *not
   nameable* in under ten words!
** Take That!
   Called the Russell-Berry Paradox, or just the Berry Paradox, this
   is one of the easier language-referential paradoxes to grasp.
*** TODO Task 1
   Grapple with this (and related) paradoxes with your partner. Discuss
   various types of paradoxes you have encountered in your travels.
*** TODO Task 2
    Look up and read the Edgar Allan Poe \ldquo{}prose poem\rdquo /The Power of Words/, and
    discuss it with your partner. You might even take turns reading out loud,
    one of you taking the role of Oinos and the other of Agathos. (Be prepared
    to have to look up some words!)
