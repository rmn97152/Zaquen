* TODO Divide and Conquer in Pairs the Properties of Probabilities!
  Remember that probability distributions satisfy two conditions:

  1. 0 \le p(s) \le 1 for each s \in S, and
  2. \sum_{s \in S} p(s) = 1.

  Knowing these two conditions and how the s events partition the probability
  space, we can infer these three additional facts:

  1. For the *complementary* event, $p(\overline{s}) = 1 - p(s)$.
  2. For the *union* of two events (either one or both happen), p(E \cup F) =
     p(E) + p(F) - p(E \cap F).
  3. For *independent events*, p(E \cap F) = p(E)p(F).

  Furthermore, the probability of the union of two independent events is the sum
  of the probabilities of the two events minus the product of their
  probabilities.

  Given the above, what can you say about the probability of the union of two
  *mutually exclusive* events?
